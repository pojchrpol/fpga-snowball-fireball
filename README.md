# Snowball Fireball Game 
### Created on Basys 3 FPGA Development Board with Pmod Mic3 and Pmod OLEDrgb

The project aims to create Sight and Sound Entertainment System on FPGA board with two additional devies: microphone and OLED screen.
This project adopts basic concept of Digital Design in combinational circuits, sequential circuits, along with finite state machine, writing Verilog codes to create four main interactive features as presented in the table.
